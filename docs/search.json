      "contents": "\n\nBeyond teaching and academics, Kyle has quite a few hobbies that fall into two big categories: sports and geeks.\n\n\nSports\n\n\n He currently plays professional Ultimate for the Los Angeles Aviators. As an undergraduate, he studied abroad in Perth, Australia where he learned how to play ultimate. Since he was abroad, Kyle spent way too much getting better at ultimate. After returning to the states, he immediately tried out for a pro team. It took 3 tries, but he first made the Aviators in 2019 and has played with them since. To the left is a photo of Kyle playing in his first Game of the Week in front of an international audience (PC: Meg Hofner). This particular throw ended up making the top plays of the week (well, technically, the catch made the top plays of the week). The video is below.\n\n\n\n\n Kyle has also been an active juggler since 2009. His best friend at the time was one of the world’s best jugglers and they spent many hours every week working on the ultimate craft for introverts. The picture to the right (PC: Casey Rentmeester) is a classic 5 club cascade (the normal juggling pattern for an odd number of objects). Before moving to California, Kyle attended a few juggling conventions annually and even prepared to participate in a technical juggling competition. Although he didn’t compete, Kyle trained for 3 hours a day to prepare for competition. At the time, his personal records are 9 balls, 7 rings, and 6 clubs. Nowadays, Kyle juggles for about an hour a week split across 3-4 days. If he juggles with other people, he much prefers to work on passing patterns (2 or more people juggling together by throwing objects back and forth) with 6, 7, and 8 clubs, or to play combat with 3 clubs.\n\n\nGeeks\n\n\nWhen Kyle is recovering from his more active endeavors, he watches a lot of anime. His favorites are old-school: Yu Yu Hakusho and Rurouni Kenshin. However, he has watched a lot of good anime and definitely recommends:\n\nSoul Eater\n\n\nToradora\n\n\nLove, Chuunibyou & Other Delusions\n\n\nMy Hero Academia\n\n\nSeven Deadly Sins.\n\n\nSticking with the theme of escapism, Kyle loves to read science fiction, fantasy, and dystopian future novels in the young adult genre. He especially loves 3-10 book series where he can feel as though he has a connection with the main characters. Some of his favorites include:\n\nThe Name of the Wind (by Patrick Rothfuss)\n\n\nThe Hunger Games (by Suzanne Collins)\n\n\nThe Novice (by Taran Matharu)\n\n\nGraceling Realm (by Kristin Cashore)\n\n\nAn Ember in the Ashes (by Sabaa Tahir)\n\n\nKyle’s only vices come from having a bit of a card collection problem (Yu-Gi-Oh!, Yu Yu Hakusho, Original Pokemon sets, and original Digimon sets…so far), and playing a relatively small and selective set of video games. Well, he might also be very addicted to sugar.\n\n\nMore information to come when Kyle is finally able to adopt the objectively cutest animal ever (the exact animal is TBD, but it will undoubtedly be the best and cutest).\n\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\n\nMy research is currently focused on developing statistical methods for censored survival data. My research focus is driven by an application to Native American health care systems and health disparities. My first dissertation problem is to examine the effect of unknown interval censoring in recurrent event EHR data under the proportional hazards assumption and an easy way to reduce bias. The second project is to develop a prediction model to dealing with unknown interval censoring when the proportional hazards assumption does not hold. The final project is to extend the time-dependent AUROC curves to the multivariate case in order to improve model selection in the prior projects. On the side, I am (lightly) working on sports analytics for ranking Ultimate teams and identifying the most useful metrics for predicting the winner of a game.\n\n\n  Collaborations\n  \n  \n  Center for American Indian and Alaskan Native Health (Link)\n  \n    \n  The center is currently working on understanding dementia in AIAN populations via two main pathways and two main outcomes.  On the pre-dementia end, the goal is to understand what sociodemographic factors are associated with onset of dementia and what modifiable risk factors influence the onset of dementia, with a special emphasis on the relationship between diabetes and dementia.  After developing dementia, the goal is to understand if (and how) health service utilization changes, what is most effective, and the resulting costs.\n    \n  \n  \n  Liberty University Helms School of Government Professor Projects Course\n  \n    \n  Through a connection with Dr. Kahlib Fischer, I worked with class groups to think about organizing and running quantitative public policy related research projects.  Previous projects I worked with include two different projects on the relationship between lockdowns and COVID-19 cases in both the United States and internationally.   Another project focused on how voting laws impact voter fraud.  The goal of the course is to introduce students to research in the field of public policy, but the projects are meant to be conducted with a potential for presenting and publishing an article after 2 semesters.\n    \n\n\n\nResearch Interests\n\n\nMy research interests are primarily driven by the areas of application and/or in applied directions. Listed below are my main statistical areas of interest with reasons/applications sub-listed below the topics:\n\nSurvival Analysis\n\n\nHealth disparities\n\n\nNative American health\n\n\nHealth care costs\n\n\nElectronic health records\n\n\nSports Stats\n\n\nRankings\n\n\nOutcome Prediciton\n\n\nStrategy Development\n\n\nStrategy Analysis\n\n\nPlayer Development\n\n\nPedagogy\n\n\nRemote Teaching\n\n\nFlipped Classrooms\n\n\nUsing internet resources to improve learning\n\n\nDeveloping introductory material for non-stats students taking stats courses\n\n\nDeveloping applications for aiding and teaching students of statistics\n\n\nTime series\n\n\nConcussions\n\n\nHead Trauma\n\n\nStress\n\n\nNeuroimaging\n\n\nSleep\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\n\n\nKyle has over 10 years of tutoring experience. He has refined his 1-on-1 tutoring technique to emphasize using the student’s own learning style to maximize their knowledge base in the subject. Thus, when a faced with a challenging question, students are prepared to think through the question in their own terms. If you are looking for an experienced, personable tutor who will focus on your learning, then reach out to Kyle by sending him an email: krconnif@uci.edu.\n\n\n\n\nCurrent number of students for winter 2021: 10\n\n\nStudent count last updated: 4/22/2021\n\n\n\n\nResume\n\n\nIndependent Tutor (2012-Current)\n\nI’ve met 1-on-1 with students for several years. I’ve worked completely independently with students (UCI page below), as well as through tutoring systems (the second and third links below).\n\nUCI Stats Department\n\n\nTakeLessons\n\n\nWyzant\n\n\n\n\nTeaching Assistant: Introduction to Statistics  (2018, 2020)\n\nWorked with the teacher to help teach introductory statistics during the shortened summer sessions. I taught review sessions, created test questions, checked homework and lab assignments, and mostly helped answer student questions about the material, homeworks, and labs.\n\n\n\nSt. Norbert College Multicultural Center Tutor (2012-2013)\n\nSimilar to holding office hours, I sat in a large room and helped my multicultural peers with all levels of math from algebra through multivariate calculus, introductory economics, writing/editing, and a few other introductory classes I was also taking.\n\n\n\nBoy’s & Girl’s Club Tutor (2012-2013)\n\nI helped students at an undisclosed, minority-serving middle school (6-8th grades) work through all types of math questions.\n\n\n\nRanger Ambassador (2011-2012)\n\nI helped a kindergarten/1st grade teacher with teaching students who needed a little extra help learn how to add and subtract.\n\n\n\nBoy’s & Girl’s Club Program Staff (2009-2016)\n\nI designed and implemented games and activities for teaching and entertaining children aged 5-18. I primarily worked with children with no place to go after school on fundamental tasks such as cooking, homework, and being aware of/respectful to others around them.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecently Tutored Courses\n\n\nCollege Introduction to Statistics\n\n\nCollege Pre-calculus\n\n\nCollege Algebra\n\n\nHigh school Math 3\n\n\nPre-calculus\n\n\nHigh School AP Calculus A/B\n\n\nHigh School AP Calculus B/C\n\n\nQuantitative Methods in Ecological Sciences\n\n\nIntermediate Mathematical Statistics\n\n\nHigh School AP Statistics\n\n\nBiostatistics for Nurses\n\n\nMiddle School Algebra\n\n\nHow to teach Statistics for Public Policy\n\n\nMasters of Teaching Capstone Research Project\n\n\n\n\nRate\n\n\n$50/hour for most college and high school level courses.\n\n\nRates for children depend on the subjects and expectations of the parents. Creating lesson plans and teaching subjects will be more expensive than helping with homework. Please reach out to address expectations and come to an agreement on hourly rate.\n\n\nNote: all prices are negotiable. If you explain your situation, I’m sure we can come to an agreement on an acceptable rate. Students paying for themselves are typically afforded the most leeway. If you aren’t sure, just ask. My focus is on student learning, not income.\n\n\nSecond note: I don’t charge for short questions that are texted or emailed to me. If you have a quick question, send me a pic and I’ll answer quickly via the same medium. I will recommend a session if I think it will require a substantial amount of time.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Information\n\n\nKyle’s tutoring style may not be entirely typical. He will very rarely give students the answers to questions. He does not oftentimes answer students’ questions in his own terms. Instead, he will turn questions around to the students. He will ask them to return to their notes and review what the teacher said. He will break the question into pieces and encourage the student to build up their understanding of the information as it relates to previously covered material. In essence, Kyle is a teacher. His focus is on teaching, and tutoring is on opportunity to be a 1-on-1 teacher.\n\nTutoring plays a big role in the development of Kyle’s teaching materials. He has learned a lot about how to not organize a class from tutoring. He has learned a lot about what topics students struggle with in various classes. He develops teaching resources based on what would be most beneficial to his tutees. His goal in teaching is to make each student feel as though they are being guided through the material by an individual tutor. And tutoring is one of the methods he practices and refines the process of achieving this goal.\n\n\n\n\n\n",
