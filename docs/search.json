      "contents": "\n\nBeyond teaching and academics, Kyle has quite a few hobbies that fall\ninto two big categories: sports and geeks.\n\n\nSports\n\n\n\nHe currently plays professional Ultimate for the\nLos Angeles Aviators. As an\nundergraduate, he studied abroad in Perth, Australia where he learned\nhow to play ultimate. Since he was abroad, Kyle spent way too much\ngetting better at ultimate. After returning to the states, he\nimmediately tried out for a pro team. It took 3 tries, but he first made\nthe Aviators in 2019 and has played with them since. To the left is a\nphoto of Kyle playing in his first Game of the Week in front of an\ninternational audience (PC:\nMeg Hofner). This\nparticular throw ended up making the top plays of the week (well,\ntechnically, the catch made the top plays of the week). The video is\nbelow.\n\n\n\n\n\nKyle has also been an active juggler since 2009. His best\nfriend at the time was one of the world’s best jugglers and they spent\nmany hours every week working on the ultimate craft for introverts. The\npicture to the right (PC:\nCasey\nRentmeester) is a classic 5 club cascade (the normal juggling\npattern for an odd number of objects). Before moving to California, Kyle\nattended a few juggling conventions annually and even prepared to\nparticipate in a technical juggling competition. Although he didn’t\ncompete, Kyle trained for 3 hours a day to prepare for competition. At\nthe time, his personal records are 9 balls, 7 rings, and 6 clubs.\nNowadays, Kyle juggles for about an hour a week split across 3-4 days.\nIf he juggles with other people, he much prefers to work on passing\npatterns (2 or more people juggling together by throwing objects back\nand forth) with 6, 7, and 8 clubs, or to play combat with 3 clubs.\n\n\nGeeks\n\n\nWhen Kyle is recovering from his more active endeavors, he watches a lot\nof anime. His favorites are old-school: Yu Yu\nHakusho and Rurouni Kenshin. However, he has watched a lot\nof good anime and definitely recommends:\n\nSoul Eater\n\n\nToradora\n\n\nLove, Chuunibyou & Other Delusions\n\n\nMy Hero Academia\n\n\nSeven Deadly Sins.\n\n\nSticking with the theme of escapism, Kyle loves to read\nscience fiction, fantasy, and dystopian future novels in the young adult\ngenre. He especially loves 3-10 book series where he can feel as though\nhe has a connection with the main characters. Some of his favorites\ninclude:\n\nThe Name of the Wind (by\nPatrick\nRothfuss)\n\n\nThe Hunger Games (by\nSuzanne Collins)\n\n\nThe Novice (by Taran\nMatharu)\n\n\nGraceling Realm (by\nKristin Cashore)\n\n\nAn Ember in the Ashes (by\nSabaa Tahir)\n\n\nKyle’s only vices come from having a bit of a card\ncollection problem (Yu-Gi-Oh!, Yu Yu Hakusho, Original Pokemon\nsets, and original Digimon sets…so far), and playing a relatively small\nand selective set of video games. Well, he might also be very addicted\nto sugar.\n\n\nMore information to come when Kyle is finally able to adopt the\nobjectively cutest animal ever (the exact animal is TBD, but it will\nundoubtedly be the best and cutest).\n\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\n\nMy research is currently focused on developing statistical methods for\ncensored survival data. My research focus is driven by an application to\nNative American health care systems and health disparities. My first\ndissertation problem is to examine the effect of unknown interval\ncensoring in recurrent event EHR data under the proportional hazards\nassumption and an easy way to reduce bias. The second project is to\ndevelop a prediction model to dealing with unknown interval censoring\nwhen the proportional hazards assumption does not hold. The final\nproject is to extend the time-dependent AUROC curves to the multivariate\ncase in order to improve model selection in the prior projects. On the\nside, I am (lightly) working on sports analytics for ranking Ultimate\nteams and identifying the most useful metrics for predicting the winner\nof a game.\n\n\n\nCollaborations\n\n\nCenter for American Indian and Alaskan Native Health\n(Link)\n\nThe center is currently working on understanding dementia in AIAN\npopulations via two main pathways and two main outcomes. On the\npre-dementia end, the goal is to understand what sociodemographic\nfactors are associated with onset of dementia and what modifiable risk\nfactors influence the onset of dementia, with a special emphasis on the\nrelationship between diabetes and dementia. After developing dementia,\nthe goal is to understand if (and how) health service utilization\nchanges, what is most effective, and the resulting costs.\n\nLiberty University Helms School of Government Professor Projects Course\n\nThrough a connection with\nDr. Kahlib\nFischer, I worked with class groups to think about organizing and\nrunning quantitative public policy related research projects. Previous\nprojects I worked with include two different projects on the\nrelationship between lockdowns and COVID-19 cases in both the United\nStates and internationally. Another project focused on how voting laws\nimpact voter fraud. The goal of the course is to introduce students to\nresearch in the field of public policy, but the projects are meant to be\nconducted with a potential for presenting and publishing an article\nafter 2 semesters.\n\n\n\nResearch Interests\n\n\nMy research interests are primarily driven by the areas of application\nand/or in applied directions. Listed below are my main statistical areas\nof interest with reasons/applications sub-listed below the topics:\n\nSurvival Analysis\n\n\nHealth disparities\n\n\nNative American health\n\n\nHealth care costs\n\n\nElectronic health records\n\n\nSports Stats\n\n\nRankings\n\n\nOutcome Prediciton\n\n\nStrategy Development\n\n\nStrategy Analysis\n\n\nPlayer Development\n\n\nPedagogy\n\n\nRemote Teaching\n\n\nFlipped Classrooms\n\n\nUsing internet resources to improve learning\n\n\nDeveloping introductory material for non-stats students taking stats\ncourses\n\n\nDeveloping applications for aiding and teaching students of statistics\n\n\nTime series\n\n\nConcussions\n\n\nHead Trauma\n\n\nStress\n\n\nNeuroimaging\n\n\nSleep\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\n\nKyle has over 10 years of tutoring experience. He has refined his\n1-on-1 tutoring technique to emphasize using the student’s own learning\nstyle to maximize their knowledge base in the subject. Thus, when a\nfaced with a challenging question, students are prepared to think\nthrough the question in their own terms. If you are looking for an\nexperienced, personable tutor who will focus on your learning, then\nreach out to Kyle by sending him an email:\nkrconnif@uci.edu.\n\nCurrent number of students for fall 2021: 4\n\n\nStudent count last updated: 10/172021\n\n\n\n\nResume\n\n\nTeaching Assistant: UCI COSMOS: Exploring the Application of\nData Science in the Health Sciences (July, 2021)\n\nWorked with high school students to help them develop insight into how\ndata science can be used to save and advance human lives. I lead\ndiscussions, answered questions during lectures, graded assignments, and\nhelped students with an analysis project to end the course.\n\nUCI\nCOSMOS Cluster 1: Data Science in the Health Sciences\n\n\n\n\nTeaching Assistant: Introduction to Probability and Statistics\nI (Summer 2021)\n\nWorked with lecturer to provide remote teaching to students taking a\nmajor-level course in mathematical statistics. I held office hours,\ngraded assignments and exams, and proctored exams.\n\n\n\nIndependent Tutor (2012-Current)\n\nI’ve met 1-on-1 with students for several years. I’ve worked completely\nindependently with students (UCI page below), as well as through\ntutoring systems (the second and third links below).\n\nUCI Stats\nDepartment\n\n\nTakeLessons\n\n\nWyzant\n\n\n\n\nTeaching Assistant: Introduction to Statistics  (Summer\n2018, Summer 2020)\n\nWorked with the teacher to help teach introductory statistics during the\nshortened summer sessions. I taught review sessions, created test\nquestions, checked homework and lab assignments, and mostly helped\nanswer student questions about the material, homeworks, and labs.\n\n\n\nSt. Norbert College Multicultural Center Tutor\n(2012-2013)\n\nSimilar to holding office hours, I sat in a large room and helped my\nmulticultural peers with all levels of math from algebra through\nmultivariate calculus, introductory economics, writing/editing, and a\nfew other introductory classes I was also taking.\n\n\n\nBoy’s & Girl’s Club Tutor (2012-2013)\n\nI helped students at an undisclosed, minority-serving middle school\n(6-8th grades) work through all types of math questions.\n\n\n\nRanger Ambassador (2011-2012)\n\nI helped a kindergarten/1st grade teacher with teaching students who\nneeded a little extra help learn how to add and subtract.\n\n\n\nBoy’s & Girl’s Club Program Staff (2009-2016)\n\nI designed and implemented games and activities for teaching and\nentertaining children aged 5-18. I primarily worked with children with\nno place to go after school on fundamental tasks such as cooking,\nhomework, and being aware of/respectful to others around them.\n\n\n\n\n\nRecently Tutored Courses\n\n\nCollege Introduction to Statistics\n\n\nCollege Pre-calculus\n\n\nCollege Algebra\n\n\nHigh school Math 3\n\n\nPre-calculus\n\n\nHigh School AP Calculus A/B\n\n\nHigh School AP Calculus B/C\n\n\nQuantitative Methods in Ecological Sciences\n\n\nIntermediate Mathematical Statistics\n\n\nHigh School AP Statistics\n\n\nBiostatistics for Nurses\n\n\nMiddle School Algebra\n\n\nHow to teach Statistics for Public Policy\n\n\nMasters of Teaching Capstone Research Project\n\n\n\n\nRate\n\n\n$65/hour for most college and high school level courses.\n\n\nRates for children depend on the subjects and expectations of the\nparents. Creating lesson plans and teaching subjects will be more\nexpensive than helping with homework. Please reach out to address\nexpectations and come to an agreement on hourly rate.\n\n\nNote: all prices are negotiable. If you explain your situation, I’m sure\nwe can come to an agreement on an acceptable rate. Students paying for\nthemselves are typically afforded the most leeway. If you aren’t sure,\njust ask. My focus is on student learning, not income.\n\n\nSecond note: I don’t charge for short questions that are texted or\nemailed to me. If you have a quick question, send me a pic and I’ll\nanswer quickly via the same medium. I will recommend a session if I\nthink it will require a substantial amount of time.\n\n\n\n\nAdditional Information\n\nKyle’s tutoring style may not be entirely typical. He will very\nrarely give students the answers to questions. He does not oftentimes\nanswer students’ questions in his own terms. Instead, he will turn\nquestions around to the students. He will ask them to return to their\nnotes and review what the teacher said. He will break the question into\npieces and encourage the student to build up their understanding of the\ninformation as it relates to previously covered material. In essence,\nKyle is a teacher. His focus is on teaching, and tutoring is on\nopportunity to be a 1-on-1 teacher.\nTutoring plays a big role in the development of Kyle’s teaching\nmaterials. He has learned a lot about how to not organize a class from\ntutoring. He has learned a lot about what topics students struggle with\nin various classes. He develops teaching resources based on what would\nbe most beneficial to his tutees. His goal in teaching is to make each\nstudent feel as though they are being guided through the material by an\nindividual tutor. And tutoring is one of the methods he practices and\nrefines the process of achieving this goal.\n\n\n\n\n",
