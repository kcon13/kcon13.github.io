    Beyond teaching and academics, Kyle has quite a few hobbies that would stereotypically categorize him as a jock or a nerd/geek.  
    </p>
    
    <h3 class="sportsHeading">
    An an athlete:
    </h3>
    
    <p class="ultimate">
    <img id="ultimatepic" src="AviatorsPic.jpg" alt="Kyle throwing a forehand for a score against  the San Jose Spiders.  PC: Meg Hofner" style="float:left;width:200px;height:auto;padding-right:5px"/>
    He played professional <b><u>Ultimate</u></b> for the <a href="https://theaudl.com/aviators">Los Angeles Aviators</a> from 2019-2021.  As an undergraduate, he studied abroad in Perth, Australia where he learned how to play ultimate.   Since he was abroad, Kyle spent way too much time focused on getting better at ultimate.  After returning to the states, he immediately (and unsuccessfully) tried out for the Madison-based pro team.  After two more tries, he made the Aviators in 2019.  To the left is a photo of Kyle playing in his first Game of the Week in front of an international audience (PC: <a href="https://meghofner.smugmug.com/browse">Meg Hofner</a>).  This particular throw ended up making the top plays of the week (well, technically, the catch made the top plays of the week).  The video is below.  Kyle is currently debating retirement to recover from a torn ACL and finish his Ph.D work.

    <p class="juggling">
    <img id="jugglingpic" src="5clubsSNC.jpg" alt="Kyle juggling 5 clubs in an open quad.  PC: Casey Rentmeester" style="float:right;width:250px;height:auto;padding-left:5px"/>
    Kyle has also been an active <b><u>juggler</u></b> since 2009.  His best friend at the time was one of the world's best jugglers and they spent many hours every week working on the ultimate craft for introverts.    The picture to the right (PC: <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/c/meesta11/featured">Casey Rentmeester</a>) is a classic 5 club cascade (cascade = the normal juggling pattern for an odd number of objects).  Before moving to California, Kyle attended a few juggling conventions annually and even prepared to participate in a <a href="https://youtu.be/oitQgJHQtxQ">technical juggling competition</a>.  Although he didn't compete, Kyle trained for 3 hours a day to prepare for competition.  His personal records are 9 balls, 7 rings, and 6 clubs.  Nowadays, Kyle juggles here and there, but without any aspirations of competing or improving.  If he juggles with other people, he much prefers to work on <a href="https://youtu.be/0FDGlzJ3JaY">passing</a> patterns (2 or more people juggling together by throwing objects back and forth) with 6, 7, and 8 clubs, or to play <a href="https://youtu.be/RTAtCr19jV8">combat</a> with 3 clubs.
    </p>
    
    
    <h3 class="geekHeading">
    In the escapism realms:
    </h3>
    
    <p class="anime">
    When Kyle is recovering from his more active endeavors, he enjoys watching <b><u>anime</u></b>.  His favorites are old-school: <em>Yu Yu Hakusho</em> and <em>Rurouni Kenshin</em>.  However, he has watched a lot of good anime and definitely recommends:
    <ul>
      <li><em>Soul Eater</em></li>
      <li><em>Toradora</em></li>
      <li><em>Love, Chuunibyou & Other Delusions</em></li>
      <li><em>My Hero Academia</em></li>
      <li><em>Angel Beats</em>.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p class="reading">
    Sticking with the theme of escapism, Kyle loves to <b><u>read</u></b> science fiction, fantasy, and dystopian future novels, especially in the young adult genre.  He can get lost in 3-10 book series through which he can feel as though he has a connection with the main characters.  Some of his favorites include:
    <ul>
      <li><em>The Name of the Wind</em> (by <a href="https://www.patrickrothfuss.com/content/index.asp">Patrick Rothfuss</a>)</li>
      <li><em>The Hunger Games</em> (by <a href="http://www.suzannecollinsbooks.com/">Suzanne Collins</a>)</li>
      <li><em>The Novice</em> (by <a href="https://authortaranmatharu.com/">Taran Matharu</a>)</li>
      <li><em>Graceling Realm</em> (by <a href="http://kristincashore.blogspot.com/">Kristin Cashore</a>)</li>
      <li><em>An Ember in the Ashes</em> (by <a href="https://www.sabaatahir.com/">Sabaa Tahir</a>)</li> 
    </ul>
    Kyle is currently reading: <a href="https://www.davidgrann.com/book/killers-of-the-flower-moon/"><em>Killers of the Flower Moon: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI.</em></a> and <em>Golden Son</em> from the <a href="https://www.piercebrown.com/redrisingsaga">Red Rising Saga</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p class="vices">
    Kyle's only vices come from having a bit of a <b><u>card collection</u></b> problem (Yu-Gi-Oh!, Yu Yu Hakusho, Original Pokemon sets, and original Digimon sets...so far), and playing a relatively small and selective set of video games.  Well, he might also be very addicted to sugar.

<img id="drakey" src="DrakePic.png" alt="Kyle's dog is an 11 year old pitbull mix named Drake.  PC: Kyle Conniff" style="float:left;width:500px;height:auto;padding-right:5px"/> Kyle is also a dog parent.  Drake is an 11 year old pitbull-mix pound-rescue.  Details of Drake's previous life are scarce, but it is believed that he ended up on the streets after having a few previous owners.  Drake is now happy to play with his cousins (Kyle's parents' dogs) as well as cuddle on the couch with papa.  Fun fact: Drake is not afraid to steal food from his favorite sitter.  The current list includes a full pizza; fried chicken; crawfish; and a 6-inch Subway cold cut sandwich with lettuce, tomato, jalapeno, and siracha sauce.  Somehow, Drake has never exhibited the expected effects of eating such meals.  Truly a dog of dogs.</p>
